# AP CS Final Part 2 - Bootstrap feature explanations

## Navbar

The navbar makes it easy to go between different pages of the site. I customized it by adding a button on the right side with a dark mode toggle.

## Button

I used the button for my light/dark toggle and within my cards to link to the source code for my projects.

## Accordion

I used the accordion for my resume because it is a good way to group related information. I customized it by making the sections remain open regardless of if other sections are also open.

## Card

I used cards for my portfolio because they are a good way to group an image, a description, and a link to each project listed.

## Card group

I used a card group for the cards in my portfolio because it groups the cards nicely.
